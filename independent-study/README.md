+ As Harvard University and a myriad of other brick-and-mortar universities move classes online amid the coronavirus pandemic, eLearning is at the forefront of post-secondary education. 

+ During the past year at Harvard University Extension School, I have encountered many Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) methodologies for laying out web pages and online eLearning course sites, including floats, tables, positioning, inline-block, CSS columns, Flexbox, and CSS Grid.  The purpose of this set of notes is to select three of these CSS methodologies and then compare and contrast each of these CSS methods.  I will also present an examination, analysis and reflection of why one of the methodologies is the best selection for responsive design and responsive eLearning design.

# Floats, Flexbox and CSS Grid for Online Courses
+ I have selected floats, Flexbox and CSS Grid for comparison and critical review.  In order to understand these and any CSS layout methodologies, online course designers, new web designers, programmers and engineers alike must of course understand both the new border box model and the old content box model.

## Utilization and Combination of Appropriate CSS Layout Methodologies
+ When coding responsive layouts there are strengths and weaknesses of float-based layout, Flexbox layout, and CSS Grid layout.  The key is to find when is it appropriate to use each methodology and or a combination of methodologies.
+ When building an eLearning course webpage with a one-dimensional layout, Flexbox is the obvious choice because of cross browser compatibility and support.
+ However, when a two-dimensional responsive layout is required or preferred, CSS Grid will code both columns and rows in dynamic fashion and success.
+ When a web page combines both a one-dimensional and a two-dimensional responsive layout then combining these two methodologies is suggested.  Flexbox and CSS Grid integrate quite well together; online course designers and web designers are already taking advantage of the strengths of combining these methodologies in responsive design and responsive eLearning design.
